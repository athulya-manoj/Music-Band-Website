        Bands may also have a manager, sound engineer, or other staff who help with the business and technical aspects of their music.
        Rehearsal and Performance:
        <br>
        Bands spend time rehearsing together to perfect their songs before live performances or recording sessions.
        They perform live shows, either in small venues or large arenas, and some also record albums for distribution.
        Collaboration:
        <br>
        The strength of a band is in the collaboration between its members. Each personâ€™s individual talents and personalities shape the band's identity, which is why band dynamics are often a huge part of their success or failure.
